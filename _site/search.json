As head of the Department of Interactive Media and Educational Technologies at the University for Continuing Education Krems (UWK) (Austria), I researched how to apply technology in settings of Life Long Learning. \nI had held positions as a professor at several universities in Austria and Germany (Klagenfurt, Münster, Innsbruck, Hagen) before I accepted the nomination to Krems. I published 25 books (10 monographs and 15 edited volumes) and over 200 articles.\nWith my retirement, I became a Life Long Learner myself. I am interested in studying workflows for Open Science research, focusing on note-taking apps like Obsidian, Hypothes.is, etc., and the R programming language for statistical computing and data science.\n\n\n Back to top"
