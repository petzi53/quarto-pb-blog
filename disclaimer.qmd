## Declaration about the editorial policy

*Life Long Learning Lab (L3Lab)* is a personal blog by me ([Peter
Baumgartner](/about.qmd)). It focuses on news and comments about the
research and teaching on Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) and Data
Science Education with a special focus on
[R](https://www.r-project.org/ "A free software environment for statistical computing and graphics")
subjects. Using R as an tool for data analysis and interpretation
'L3Lab' covers other subjects as well.

The content of this website is my personal opinion. The purpose of this
website is not commercial and is, therefore, no professional service
provided.
